Pothole Alert: Automated Detection and Local Municipality Reporting System
Overview
Pothole Alert is a web-based application designed to enhance road maintenance by identifying and reporting potholes in real time. It captures live video frames using a device's camera, processes them, logs detections with timestamps and geolocation data via the Google Maps Geocoding API, and generates a PDF report. The system automatically emails the report to the nearby taluk or municipality for swift action, improving road safety.
Features

Real-time pothole detection from live camera feed.
Geolocation-based reporting using Google Maps API.
Automated PDF generation and email dispatch to local authorities.
User-friendly interface with start/stop camera controls.
Detailed detection logs with timestamps and locations.
